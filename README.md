# JOINT

> A place to meet and collaborate.


Joint is an effort to make the interviews better.Its an open source platform which supports parallel editing with video and chat support. Its built with *[peerjs](https://peerjs.com/)* and *[firepad](https://firepad.io)*.
-

The video streaming is via WebRTC and is not stored on any server. So those who participate don't have to worry about the privacy and the chat server is hosted on the firebase and data will be stored in encrypted form which can only be read by the message hash provided by the initiator ,and that will self destruct once you terminate the session.


### Building something new  doesn't mean inventing something new.

## Made in love with nodeJS :heart:
